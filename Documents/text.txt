Scene Setup:
Create a new Unity project.
Design your main area scene with the table, keyholes, and visible doors.
Place the doors in the scene, each labelled as “Door 1,” “Door 2,” etc.
Set up the camera view so that the player can see the doors and the table.
Door Prefabs:
Create door prefabs for each level. These prefabs will have a script attached to them to handle opening and closing.
Each door prefab should have a unique identifier (e.g., “Door 1,” “Door 2,” etc.).
Key Prefabs:
Create key prefabs for each level. These prefabs will be collectible items.
Attach a script to the key prefabs to handle interactions (e.g., picking up the key).
Player Interaction:
Write a script for the player controller.
When the player approaches a door, check if they have the corresponding key.
If they do, allow them to interact with the door (e.g., press a button to open it).
Level Progression:
Create a manager script to keep track of the player’s progress.
Initially, only “Door 1” is open.
When the player solves the puzzle inside the room behind “Door 1,” they receive the key for “Door 2.”
The manager script should handle unlocking subsequent doors as the player progresses.
Puzzle Rooms:
Create separate scenes for each puzzle room (behind each door).
Design unique puzzles for each room. These can be anything from logic puzzles to platform challenges.
When the player solves a puzzle, they receive the key for the next door.
Key Collection:
When the player collects a key, update the manager script to reflect their progress.
For example, if they collect the key for “Door 2,” set a flag that allows them to open “Door 2.”
Final Level:
Once the player has collected all four keys, unlock the final door.
Behind this door, create a special room or scene to signify the completion of the game.
Win Condition:
When the player enters the final room, display a victory message or animation.
You can also add a restart button to play again.
Testing and Refinement:
Test your game thoroughly to ensure that the progression works correctly.
Refine the puzzles, adjust difficulty, and make sure everything feels cohesive.test
