# CS458 Triple Challange

# Project Description
The primary goal of this project is to design and develop a collection of interactive puzzle challenges that are specifically designed for VR environments. The puzzles will require user interaction within virtual environments and users will manipulate virtual objects and images to navigate through scenarios to solve a variety of puzzles/mini games.

# Citation/Inspiration
The project draws inspiration from games like “The Witness” with its intricate puzzles and immersive environments to create a virtual reality experience centered around interactive challenges. Drawing from The Witness’s diverse puzzle designs, the goal is to create multiple VR settings in which the player can explore the environment to solve the puzzles. The Witness game can be accessed at:

# Makeup of Group/Roles
Since our group only consists of two members, we can split the work amongst the two of us right down the middle. Both Dylan and Zeeshan will work on the initiation, planning, execution, and closure of the project throughout its lifecycle. 

# Difficulty Level Relative to Current Knowledge
We believe that the difficulty level of the project reflects our group’s current knowledge and experience well. We both have zero prior experience with making VR games. We believe that the simple concept of a puzzle game with some interesting/challenging mechanics and level design will be a great way to expand our coding repertoire along with helping to get a deeper respect for game designers.

# Rough Milestones

Milestone #1: Concept and Design
Define the overall concept and theme of the game
Design the core mechanics and gameplay elements
Define the types of puzzles we will include
Rough sketch or prototype of the first level
Implement the basic VR controls and interactions (movement and collision)

Milestone #2: Puzzle Development
Design a variety of puzzles, with different levels of complexity
Implement puzzle mechanics (grabbing, moving and flipping the pieces)

Milestone #3: Prototyping and MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Create a prototype with a single puzzle type and minimal interactions
Test the prototype to refine the puzzle concept

Milestone #4: User Testing and Iteration
Testing all the VR puzzles and gathering feedback
Test difficulty, interaction and responsiveness of the project
Make changes based on user input

Milestone #5: Optimization and Performance
Refine and polish the overall game design, addressing our playtesting results
Optimize VR performance to ensure smooth gameplay
Implement our additional features (sound effects, music, narrative elements)
